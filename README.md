# Diffuion Modell
here you can find a simple but efficient diffusion training code. This repository includes the auto labeler named "auto_label.py" and an dataset toll named "dataset.py". It also contains a generate code named "generate.py". This is a gardio webapp where you can create a image using your latest modell in the folder checkpoints. There is also a train.py where you can train your image. For most options you can use the standart value. I tested the code on my RTX 2000 ada 16 gb. It could only run with batch size = 1. I think maybe with a rtx 4090 or something like that you could try batch size = 2. It also depends on your Image size.

Have Fun!
